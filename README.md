# Thread Sanitizer Fuzzer
We take advantage of the [Fuzzing concept](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) combined with [Thread Sanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual) tool, in order to achieve great abilities to find Race Condition bugs in multi-threaded code.

## Usage

```python
cd Scripts/
./run.sh
```
